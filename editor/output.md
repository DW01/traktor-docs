# Output - Pipeline Monitoring

The **Output** tab in the editor shows build logs and pipeline activity in real-time. When you save an asset and the pipeline processes it, all the details appear here. Which assets are being built, whether builds succeeded or failed, warnings about potential issues, and timing information for performance analysis.

This is where you go to understand what the pipeline is doing. If an asset fails to build, the Output tab shows the error messages and stack traces. If builds are slow, you can see which processors are taking time. The Output tab gives you visibility into the automated build process that transforms your source assets into runtime-ready data.

You can filter messages, search for specific assets or errors, and export logs for troubleshooting. The Output tab is essential for debugging pipeline issues and understanding the asset build process.
