# Audio - Editor Volume Control

The **Audio** tab controls audio playback volume within the editor. When you're working on your game and testing audio—previewing sound effects, listening to music tracks, or testing 3D spatial audio—this tab lets you adjust the overall volume without affecting your system settings.

This is a simple but essential tool for audio work. Lower the volume when you need to concentrate on visual editing, raise it when tuning audio balance, or mute it entirely when collaborating in a noisy environment. The Audio tab ensures you have quick control over editor audio output.
