# Getting Started with Traktor

This guide walks you through building Traktor from source, creating your first project, and making a simple scene. By the end, you'll have a working development environment and understand the basic workflow for making games with Traktor.

## System Requirements

Before you start, make sure your system meets these requirements:

**Graphics card:** You need a Vulkan 1.3 capable GPU. Most modern graphics cards from NVIDIA, AMD, or Intel support this. If you're unsure, check your GPU manufacturer's specifications.

**Operating system:** Traktor's editor and build tools run on **Windows** or **Linux**. macOS is not currently supported for development (though you can build games for macOS as a deployment target).

**Build tools:** On Windows, you need **Visual Studio 2019 or newer** with C++ development tools installed. On Linux, you need **GCC** or **Clang** with C++17 support.

---

## Installation

You have two options for getting Traktor: download prebuilt binaries or build from source.

### Download Prebuilt Binaries

The fastest way to try Traktor is to download the latest binary release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/apistol78/traktor/releases). Download the appropriate package for your platform, extract it, and you're ready to run the editor.

**Important:** Prebuilt releases may lag behind the latest source code. If you encounter bugs or want the newest features, build from source instead.

### Build from Source (Recommended)

Building from source gives you the latest code, bug fixes, and features. It also lets you modify the engine and contribute improvements.

**1. Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/apistol78/traktor.git
cd traktor
```

The `--recursive` flag is important. It fetches all submodules (third-party libraries) that Traktor depends on.

**2. Build for your platform:**

Follow the platform-specific instructions:
- **[Build on Windows](./build-windows/)** - Using Visual Studio
- **[Build on Linux](./build-linux/)** - Using GCC or Clang

These guides walk you through configuring your build environment, compiling the engine, and running the editor for the first time.

## Create Your First Project

Once you have the editor running, it's time to create a project.

### Creating a New Workspace

A "workspace" in Traktor is your game project. It contains all your assets, scenes, scripts, and settings.

1. **Launch the Traktor editor** - Run `Traktor.Editor.App.exe` (Windows) or `Traktor.Editor.App` (Linux)
2. **Create a new workspace** - Go to **File → New Workspace**
3. **Choose a template** - Select **Desktop** for a PC/Linux game project
4. **Name your project** - Enter a name like "MyFirstGame"
5. **Select a location** - Choose where to save the project on your filesystem
6. **Click OK** - The editor creates the project structure and opens it

![TODO: Screenshot showing the New Workspace dialog with template selection and project settings]

### Understanding the Project Structure

After creation, your project directory looks like this:

```
MyFirstGame/
├── MyFirstGame.workspace     # Workspace configuration file
├── data/
│   ├── Source/               # Your editable assets (scenes, scripts, textures)
│   ├── Output/               # Built/cooked assets (generated by pipeline)
│   └── Temp/                 # Temporary build files (safe to delete)
└── info/                     # Additional project metadata
```

**Source** is where you work. All your scenes, materials, scripts, and textures go here. This is what you edit and version control.

**Output** contains the optimized runtime assets. The pipeline generates these automatically when you save changes. Don't edit these files manually.

**Temp** stores intermediate build files. You can safely delete this directory; it will be regenerated when needed.

The editor uses special file extensions for asset management:
- **`.xdi`** (Database Instance) - Your actual asset data
- **`.xdm`** (Database Metadata) - Asset type and dependency information
- **`.xil`** (Instance Link) - References to other assets
- **`.xgl`** (Group Link) - References to asset folders

## Creating Your First Scene

Now let's make a simple 3D scene with lighting and geometry.

### Step 1: Create a Scene Asset

In the editor, find the **Database** panel on the left. This is where all your assets live.

1. **Create a folder** - Right-click on **Source** and select **New Group**. Name it **Scenes** (press F2 to rename)
2. **Create a scene** - Right-click the **Scenes** folder and select **New Instance**
3. **Choose the type** - Select **Scene** category, then **SceneAsset** type
4. **Name it** - Enter "MyScene" and click **OK**

The scene asset now appears in the Database, but you haven't opened it yet.

![TODO: Screenshot showing the Database panel with right-click context menu for creating a new scene asset]

### Step 2: Open the Scene Editor

**Double-click MyScene** in the Database. The first time you open a scene, the editor builds some internal assets. This takes a few seconds. Once ready, the Scene Editor opens, showing an empty, dark viewport. Don't worry, this is normal. There's no lighting yet.

![TODO: Screenshot showing the empty Scene Editor viewport with the dark scene]

### Step 3: Add Lighting

A scene without lights is completely black. Let's add basic lighting so you can see what you're building.

Entities in Traktor are organized into **layers** for better organization. Let's create an **Environment** layer for lights and atmosphere:

1. **Create a layer** - In the Scene Editor's Entities panel, right-click and add a new layer called **Environment**
2. **Add a Sun** - Right-click the Environment layer, add a new entity, name it "Sun", and add a **DirectionalLight** component. This provides your main light source.
3. **Add a Sky** - Create another entity called "Sky" and add a **Sky** component for atmospheric rendering
4. **Add a Probe** (optional) - Create a "Probe" entity with an **Environment** component for reflections

Your scene should now be visible with basic lighting. You'll see the sky gradient and any objects you add will be lit by the sun.

### Step 4: Add Geometry with CSG

Traktor doesn't have built-in primitive shapes like cubes or spheres in the editor menu. Instead, it uses **CSG (Constructive Solid Geometry)**. A system for building meshes from basic shapes using boolean operations.

Let's create a simple cube using CSG:

1. **Create an Objects layer** - Right-click in the Entities panel and add a layer called **Objects**
2. **Create an entity** - Right-click the Objects layer, add an entity, name it "MyCube"
3. **Add CSG components** - Select MyCube and add both a **Group Component** and a **Solid Component** from the Properties panel
4. **Create a primitive shape** - Right-click MyCube in the entity hierarchy and create a child entity called "Box"
5. **Add the primitive** - Select the Box child entity and add a **Primitive Component**
6. **Configure it** - In the Primitive Component properties, set the operation to **Union** and the shape to **BoxShape**

You should now see a cube in your scene! CSG works by combining, subtracting, or intersecting primitive shapes. For now, you have a single box, but you can create complex geometry by adding more primitives with different operations.

## What's Next?

Congratulations! You've built Traktor from source, created a project, and made your first scene. Here's where to go from here:

**Learn the workflow** - Read the [Editor Documentation](../editor/) to understand the Database, Pipeline, Scene Editor, and deployment tools. The editor is your primary workspace, so mastering it will make development much faster.
